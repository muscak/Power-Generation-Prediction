# ☀️ Renewable Power Generation Prediction
> Renewable energy (or green energy) is energy from renewable natural resources that are replenished on a human timescale. Using renewable energy technologies helps with climate change mitigation, energy security, and also has some economic benefits. Commonly used renewable energy types include solar energy, wind power, hydropower, bioenergy and geothermal power [wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renewable_energy).

## Problem Statement
Our target is to predict Renewable Energy Output by analyzing the relationship between weather and past energy generation, you can develop models to predict future output, aiding in grid management and energy planning.
