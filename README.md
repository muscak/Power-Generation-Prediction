# ☀️ Renewable Power Generation Prediction
> Renewable energy (or green energy) is energy from renewable natural resources that are replenished on a human timescale. Using renewable energy technologies helps with climate change mitigation, energy security, and also has some economic benefits. Commonly used renewable energy types include solar energy, wind power, hydropower, bioenergy and geothermal power [wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renewable_energy).

## Problem Statement
Our target is to predict Renewable Energy Output by analyzing the relationship between weather and past energy generation, you can develop models to predict future output, aiding in grid management and energy planning. The model is built as a solution for a regression problem and it's not approached as a time series problem. We compared non-linear and ensemble methods. **Rondam Forest** algorithm provided the best $R^2$ score as **0.88** among the others.
